# Fiction

A ruby program to manage my fiction writings. All writings are
written in markdown.

## Install

Add bin/fiction to your PATH

## Usage

	$ fiction new "Your Story Title"
	$ cd your_story_title
	$ fiction chapter "New Chapter"
	$ fiction generate
	$ fiction serve

That will create new story with `Your Story Title`, then enter the fic directory, create new chapter, then generate it into html, and finally serve it on localhost:4000
